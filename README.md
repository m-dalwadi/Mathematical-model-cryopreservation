# A-mathematical-framework-for-developing-freezing-protocols-in-the-cryopreservation-of-cells
This repository contains the code for the numerical scheme outlined in the manuscript "A mathematical framework for developing freezing protocols in the cryopreservation of cells" by Dalwadi, Waters, Byrne, and Hewitt.

## Requirements
This code requires an up-to-date version of MATLAB.

## Instructions
Download all files and run "Full_solver.m" in MATLAB, where the argument is the dimensional cooling rate in K s^{-1}.
